                     On January 2, 2018, Commerce initiated and the ITC instituted the fourth sunset review of the antidumping duty order on clad steel plate from Japan, pursuant to section 751(c) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act).

                     As a result of its review, Commerce determined that revocation of the antidumping duty order on clad steel plate from Japan would likely lead to a continuation or recurrence of dumping and, therefore, notified the ITC of the magnitude of the margins likely to prevail should the order be revoked.

                     On December 12, 2018, the ITC published its determination, pursuant to section 751(c) of the Act, that revocation of the antidumping duty order on clad steel plate from Japan would likely lead to a continuation or recurrence of material injury to an industry in the United States within a reasonably foreseeable time.

                     steel plate of a width of 600 millimeters (mm) or more and a composite thickness of 4.5 mm or more. Clad steel plate is a rectangular finished steel mill product consisting of a layer of cladding material (usually stainless steel or nickel) which is metallurgically bonded to a base or backing of ferrous metal (usually carbon or low alloy steel) where the latter predominates by weight.

                         Cladding is the association of layers of metals of different colors or natures by molecular interpenetration of the surfaces in contact. This limited diffusion is characteristic of clad products and differentiates them from products metalized in other manners (
                        <E T="03">e.g.,</E>
                         by normal electroplating). The various cladding processes include pouring molten cladding metal onto the basic metal followed by rolling; simple hot-rolling of the cladding metal to ensure efficient welding to the basic metal; any other method of deposition of superimposing of the cladding metal followed by any mechanical or thermal process to ensure welding (
                        <E T="03">e.g.,</E>
                         electrocladding), in which the cladding metal (nickel, chromium, 
                        <E T="03">etc.</E>
                        ) is applied to the basic metal by electroplating, molecular interpenetration of the surfaces in contact then being obtained by heat treatment at the appropriate temperature with subsequent cold rolling.

                    As a result of the determinations by Commerce and the ITC that revocation of the antidumping duty order on clad steel plate from Japan would likely lead to a continuation or recurrence of dumping and material injury to an industry in the United States, pursuant to section 751(d)(2) of the Act, Commerce hereby orders the continuation of the antidumping duty order on clad steel plate from Japan. U.S. Customs and Border Protection will continue to collect antidumping duty cash deposits at the rates in effect at the time of entry for all imports of subject merchandise. The effective date of the continuation of the order will be the date of publication in the 
                    <E T="04">Federal Register</E>
                     of this notice of continuation. Pursuant to section 751(c)(2) of the Act, Commerce intends to initiate the next five-year review of the order not later than 30 days prior to the fifth anniversary of the effective date of continuation.
