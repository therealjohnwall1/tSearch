<h2>About</h2>
<p>The Administrative Conference of the United States (ACUS) was established by statute in 1964 as an independent agency of the federal government. Its purpose is to promote improvements in the efficiency, adequacy, and fairness of the procedures by which federal agencies conduct regulatory programs, administer grants and benefits, and perform related governmental functions.</p>
<p>The Administrative Conference was created as a permanent agency to continue the efforts undertaken by two temporary Administrative Conferences during the Eisenhower and Kennedy Administrations, which each recommended the creation of a permanent agency to study federal administrative procedures and develop recommendations for improvement. ACUS began operations with the appointment and confirmation of its first Chairman in 1968.Â Â </p>
<p><a href="https://www.acus.gov/sites/default/files/documents/ACUS-Statute.pdf">The Administrative Conference Act </a>is the agency's enabling statute that governsÂ its composition, mission, and operations.Â </p>

Title 5. Government Organization and Employees<br />
Part I. The Agencies Generally<br />
Chapter 5. Administrative Procedure<br />
Subchapter V. Administrative Conference of the United States</p>
<p><strong>Â§ 591. Purposes</strong></p>
<p>The purposes of this subchapter areâ</p>
<p><strong>(1)Â </strong>to provide suitable arrangements through which Federal agencies, assisted by outsideÂ experts, may cooperatively study mutual problems, exchange information, and developÂ recommendations for action by proper authorities to the end that private rights may beÂ fully protected and regulatory activities and other Federal responsibilities may be carriedÂ out expeditiously in the public interest;<br />
<strong>(2)</strong>Â to promote more effective public participation and efficiency in the rulemaking process;<br />
<strong>(3)</strong>Â to reduce unnecessary litigation in the regulatory process;<br />
<strong>(4)Â </strong>to improve the use of science in the regulatory process; and<br />
<strong>(5)</strong>Â to improve the effectiveness of laws applicable to the regulatory process.</p>
<p><strong>Â§ 592. Definitions</strong></p>
<p>For the purpose of this subchapterâ</p>
<p><strong>(1)</strong>Â âadministrative programâ includes a Federal function which involves protection of theÂ public interest and the determination of rights, privileges, and obligations of privateÂ persons through rule making, adjudication, licensing, or investigation, as those terms areÂ used in subchapter II of this chapter, except that it does not include a military or foreignÂ affairs function of the United States;<br />
<strong>(2)Â </strong>âadministrative agencyâ means an authority as defined by section 551(1) of this title;<br />
and<br />
<strong>(3)Â </strong>âadministrative procedureâ means procedure used in carrying out an administrativeÂ program and is to be broadly construed to include any aspect of agency organization,Â procedure, or management which may affect the equitable consideration of public andÂ private interests, the fairness of agency decisions, the speed of agency action, and theÂ relationship of operating methods to later judicial review, but does not include the scope ofÂ agency responsibility as established by law or matters of substantive policy committed by law to agency discretion.</p>
<p><strong>Â§ 593. Administrative Conference of the United States</strong></p>

<strong>(2)</strong>Â the chairman of each independent regulatory board or commission or an individualÂ designated by the board or commission;<br />
<strong>(3)</strong>Â the head of each Executive department or other administrative agency which isÂ designated by the President, or an individual designated by the head of the departmentÂ or agency;<br />

The Chairman shall select the members in a manner which will provideÂ broad representation of the views of private citizens and utilize diverse experience. TheÂ members shall be members of the practicing bar, scholars in the field of administrative lawÂ or government, or others specially informed by knowledge and experience with respect toÂ Federal administrative procedure.<br />
<strong>(c)Â </strong>Members of the Conference, except the Chairman, are not entitled to pay for service.Â Members appointed from outside the Federal Government are entitled to travel expenses,Â including per diem instead of subsistence, as authorized by section 5703 of this title forÂ individuals serving without pay.</p>

<strong>(B)Â </strong>such assistance may only be undertaken on a fully reimbursable basis, including allÂ direct and indirect administrative costs.<br />
